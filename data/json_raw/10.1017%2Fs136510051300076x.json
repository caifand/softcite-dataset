            "text": "Macroeconomic Dynamics publishes research of the highest theoretical, empirical or quantitative sophistication. Papers of high quality are welcomed from all areas of advanced macroeconomics and allied fields, so long as the research is founded in a rigorous scientific approach. Major advances in macroeconomics without immediate policy applications also are accepted, if they show potential for application in the future. Occasional book reviews, software reviews, announcements, conference proceedings and interviews are published."
