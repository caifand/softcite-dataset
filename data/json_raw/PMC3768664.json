            "text": "We studied the peptide-degrading anaerobic communities of methanogenic reactors from two mesophilic full-scale modified upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors treating brewery wastewater in Colombia. Most probable number (MPN) counts varied between 7.1 x 10 8 and 6.6 x 10 9 bacteria/g volatile suspended solids VSS (Methanogenic Reactor 1) and 7.2 x 10 6 and 6.4 x 10 7 bacteria/g (VSS) (Methanogenic Reactor 2). Metabolites detected in the highest positive MPN dilutions in both reactors were mostly acetate, propionate, isovalerate and, in some cases, negligible concentrations of butyrate. Using the highest positive dilutions of MPN counts, 50 dominant strains were isolated from both reactors, and 12 strains were selected for sequencing their 16S rRNA gene based on their phenotypic characteristics. The small-subunit rRNA gene sequences indicated that these strains were affiliated to the families Propionibacteriaceae, Clostridiaceae and Syntrophomonadaceae in the low G + C gram-positive group and Desulfovibrio spp. in the class \u03b4-Proteobacteria. The main metabolites detected in the highest positive dilutions of MPN and the presence of Syntrophomonadaceae indicate the effect of the syntrophic associations on the bioconversion of these substrates in methanogenic reactors. Additionally, the potential utilization of external electron acceptors for the complete degradation of amino acids by Clostridium strains confirms the relevance of these acceptors in the transformation of peptides and amino acids in these systems."

Partial sequences generated were assembled using BioEdit v5.0.1 (19)      (10). Single amino acids can be degraded either through fermentation or oxidative deamination linked to proton reduction and, the reducing equivalents produced can be removed by a biological or a chemical electron scavenger (37,33). This is possible via interspecies hydrogen transfer in the presence of hydrogenotrophic methanogens or SRB, but also when thiosulfate acts as the final electron acceptor (13).",
