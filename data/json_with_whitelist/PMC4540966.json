Both vectors were derived from pAlligator2 (Bensmihen et al. 2004;Jang et al. 2009). The NOS gene minimal promoter (pnos 105 bp; Shaw et al. 1984) was inserted into GW::LUC using HINDIII restriction sites to produce GW:pnos::LUC. Short motifs from CO promoter (Ler, CDM, \u00c02,308 to -2,214 bp; CMM, \u00c01,599 to \u00c01,428 bp; and CPM, \u00c0237 to \u00c0102 bp) were introduced into GW:pnos::LUC using GW technology. For complementation of co-2 mutation in A. thaliana, CO promoter fragments of 2.6 kb (\u00c02,617 to \u00c05 bp), 2.1 kb ( \u00c02,075 to \u00c05 bp), or 0.6 kb (\u00c0621 to \u00c05 bp) were introduced by GW technology into GW::GFP:CO (An et al. 2004) or GW::LUC (both pGreenII). For GUS expression analysis, promoters of COL1 (1,102 bp from ATG) and COL2 (1,105 bp from ATG) were introduced by GW recombination into pGreenII (GW::GUS). All plasmids for plant transformation were introduced into Agrobacterium strain GV3101 (pMP90RK) and transformed into Col-0, co-10 or co-2 plants by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent 1998). All pGreenII transgenic lines were selected using BASTA (Bayer CropScience). For pAlligator2 transgenic lines, GFP-positive seeds were selected using a Leica MZFLIII stereomicroscope equipped with GFP filters.",
