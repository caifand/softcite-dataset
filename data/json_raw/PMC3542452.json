            "text": "To assess the position and movements of the hyoid bone during deglutition in patients with open bite. Methods: Thirty-six subjects were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of anterior open bite. The open bite group (OBG) and control group each comprised 18 patients with a mean overbite of-4.9 \u00b1 1.9 mm and 1.9 \u00b1 0.7 mm. The position of the hyoid bone during the 4 stages of deglutition was evaluated by measuring vertical and horizontal movement of the bone. Results: Interactions of group and stage showed no significant effect on the measurements (p > 0.05). However, when group and stage were evaluated individually, they showed significant effects on the measurements (p < 0.001). In OBG, the hyoid bone was more inferiorly and posteriorly positioned, and this position continued during the deglutition stages. Conclusions: The hyoid bone reaches the maximum anterior position at the oral stage and maximum superior position at the pharyngeal stage during deglutition. Open bite does not change the displacement pattern of the bone during deglutition. The hyoid bone is positioned more inferiorly and posteriorly in patients with open bite because of released tension on the suprahyoid muscles."

            "text": "The hyoid bone is unique because it has no bony articulation. However, it is an insertion element for muscles, ligaments, and fasciae attached to the mandible, clavicle, sternum, cranium, and cervical vertebrae. The hyoid bone is an important part of the musculoskeletal apparatus of the craniofacial complex and factors affecting this system might have not only local but systemic effects as well. 1 Mandibular repositioning by advancement or setback sur geries reportedly changes the position of the hyoid bone by causing alterations in the tension of the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles, neck extensor muscles, and cervical fasciae. [2][3][4] Its position also changes in relation to postural changes of the head and tongue, malocclusion, and facial type. 1,[5][6][7][8][9] Several authors reported that the position of the hyoid bone is affected by the biomechanics of the suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles and the elastic membranes of the larynx and trachea. 10,11 Andersen, 12 Subtelny and Sakuda, 13 and Haralabakis et al. 9 studied the position of the hyoid bone in patients with open bite and observed the stability of its vertical position. However, Haralabakis et al., 9 who also evaluated the horizontal position of the hyoid bone according to a vertical line drawn from the Frankfort horizontal (FH) plane at porion, reported that it is positioned more pos te riorly in patients with open bite. Yet the horizontal distance of the hyoid bone from the cervical spine, pharynx, and mandibular plane (MP) is not influenced by open bite.",

            "text": "In most previous studies, cephalometric measurements were used to determine hyoid bone positioning. However, as this bone moves forward and upward during swallowing, evaluation of its movements during deglu ti tion is more important than investigating its static posi tion. Mays et al. 14 evaluated the influence of craniofacial morphology on hyoid bone movements by video fluoroscopy and demonstrated that the forward displacement of the hyoid bone during liquid swallowing is significantly related to craniofacial morphology. For instance, as the FH-MP angle (FMA) increases, the forward displacement of the hyoid bone decreases. These authors suggested that the observed effects are related to the biomechanics of the suprahyoid musculature. Sloan et al. 15 also analyzed hyoid bone behavior during deglutition by cinefluorography and detected two distinct movement patterns: a circular pattern and an oblique, elliptical pattern.",

Therefore, we evaluated the effects of anterior open bite on hyoid bone movements during deglutition by cine MRI, a noninvasive and reliable technique. To the best of our knowledge, no such study has ever been performed. The turbo-FLASH sequence was preferred because this sequence provides the best temporal resolution and sufficient spatial resolution during motion. 26 Water-swallowing sets are reportedly more reliable than dry-swallowing sets for distinguishing the stages of deglutition because the borders of soft tissues, especially the tongue, can be easily and correctly determined. 23 In this study, we used 10 mL water as the bolus. Standardization of the bolus volume is also important because it affects the movements of the hyoid bone. 27 In the current study, the vertical measurements revealed that patients with open bite had an inferiorly positioned hyoid bone during all stages of deglutition. When the movement of the hyoid bone was evaluated according to sella and the plane connecting the third cervical vertebra and retrognathion, both groups showed superior displacement of the hyoid bone from stage 1 to stages 2 and 3. The hyoid bone reached its most superior position at stage 3 and nearly returned to its initial position at stage 4. However, evaluation according to the PP revealed that the hyoid bone reached its most superior position at stage 2 in patients with open bite. This difference is probably related to anterior rotation of the PP frequently encountered in patients with anterior open bite. Andersen 12 and Subtelny and Sakuda 13 compared the vertical positions of the hyoid bone between patients with open bite and those with normal occlusion. Contrary to our findings, they found no significant differences between these groups. However, supporting our results, Haralabakis et al. 9 found that the distance between the hyoid bone and PP is greater in patients with open bite, indicating an inferior position of the hyoid bone.",

This result may seem to be conflicting. However, posterior rotation of the mandible is common in patients with anterior open bite 28 and may explain our findings. Depending on posterior mandibular rotation, the symphysis is located more inferiorly and posteriorly in these patients. The horizontal measurements revealed that, in both groups, the hyoid bone was displaced anteriorly from stage 1 to stage 2, reached its most anterior position at stage 2, and was gradually displaced in a posterior direction at stages 3 and 4. The inferior and posterior positioning of the hyoid bone during all stages of deglutition in patients with open bite can be explained by the released tension of the suprahyoid muscles.",

            "text": "Similar to our findings, many previous studies have showed a close association between the inclination of the hyoid bone and mandibular inclination. 7,9,29 Tallgren and Solow 7 reported that the vertical positional changes in the hyoid bone follow the patterns of change in mandi bular inclination, whereas the horizontal positional changes mainly follow the changes in cervical inclination and craniofacial angulation. In our opinion, the closer position of the hyoid bone to the third cervical vertebra in patients with open bite is related to hyperextension of the head in these patients, causing the cervical spine to be stretched and decreasing the distance between the third cervical vertebra and hyoid bone. In accordance with our view, Opdebeeck et al. 30 reported that the cross-section of the lower pharynx is reduced and that the hyoid bone is closer to the cervical spine in subjects with a high FMA. Encroachment of the vital pharyngeal space induces stret ching of the cervical spine and hyperextension of the head. Jena and Duggal, 29 who evaluated hyoid bone posi tion in subjects with different vertical jaw dysplasias, also reported that subjects with short face and long face syndromes have anteriorly and posteriorly positioned hyoid bones, respectively. Haralabakis et al. 9 found that the horizontal distance between the hyoid bone and the perpendicular line from the FH plane at porion is greater in patients with open bite, indicating a more posterior position of the hyoid bone. However, Subtelny and Sakuda 13 found no difference in the horizontal position of the hyoid bone in patients with open bite, contrary to our findings.   Figure 3 for measurements and abbreviations.",
