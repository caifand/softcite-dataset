Our study further demonstrated that access to health care is associated with both the frequency of health care use and health care outcomes. Diabetes complications control and management depend on a continuing interaction between health care providers and patients. Through this interaction, patients and health care providers share information, which tends to improve diabetes care and control. Lack of access to health care could make this interaction difficult, thereby bringing about negative health outcomes.",

In our unadjusted model, those who reported no place to go were less likely to control their A1C than those who used doctor offices or HMO facilities for their health care. However, this association was no longer significant in the multivariate model. Race/ethnicity has been found to be related to poor access to health care (26,27). In the U.S., Hispanics have been found to have significantly less access to health care than non-Hispanics (28)(29)(30). One study found that even though access to health care differed among Caucasians, African Americans, and Mexican Americans, the health status and outcomes for adults with type 2 diabetes did not significantly differ among these groups, and health status seemed not to be influenced by access to health care (31). Although our study also found that Hispanics had less access, we also demonstrated that the uninsured had worse glycemic control profiles than those who were insured. When we adjusted for race/ethnicity in our model, the results from the adjusted model remained almost the same as those from the unadjusted model, indicating that the association of access to health care with glycemic control was independent of race/ethnicity. These findings have never been reported before, and our study makes significant contribution to the public health literature.",

However, our data source only addressed two of these five domains (financing and use). This study used data from NHANES 1999-2008. Because the National Center for Health Statistics withdrew the 2007-2008 A1C data from public release recently, our analyses of poor glycemic control were restricted to NHANES 1999-2006 (N = 889). The decrease in sample size (from N = 1,221 to N = 889) might have affected the association of poor glycemic control with access to health care. If the 2007-2008 A1C data were available and used in our analyses, we might have enhanced our analytic power and strengthened other associations of poor glycemic control with access to health care from marginally significant to significant.",
