            "text": "Purpose: While it is known that effective clinical education requires active involvement of its participants, regular feedback, communication skills and interprofessional training, limited studies have been conducted in Korea that demonstrate how pre-residency trainees acquire their core clinical skills. This is a cross-sectional study of interns and students across a third-tier university hospital in Korea to examine where and when they acquire core clinical skills. Methods: A total of 74 students and 91 interns were asked to participate in a closed-ended questionnaire, and 50 participants (20 students and 30 interns) were involved in semistructured individual interviews. The questionnaire was based on the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies. Results: The majority of core clinical skills were acquired during their rotations in emergency medicine, general surgery, and cardiothoracic surgery. The semistructured interviews revealed that these departments required their trainees to be highly involved and analytical, and participate in clinical discourse. Conclusion: The common factor among the three departments is an environment in which trainees are highly involved in clinical duties, and are expected to make first-contact patient encounters, participate in clinical discourse, interpret investigative results and arrive at their own conclusions. Work-based learning appear to be key to the trends observed, and further study is warranted to determine whether these findings are indicative of true acquisition of clinical competence."

It is an exchange between student and teacher outside of the traditional didactic scope, and involves a patient scenario. Medical educators believe the teacher's role is to provide information to students, and be a reservoir of knowledge and skills that \"occasionally and unpredictably spill over its dam, letting information flow randomly down a canyon of learning [2].\" Expertise alone, then, is insufficient for effective clinical education.

The study participants were 91 interns and 74 recent medical school graduates who were interns-to-be. February was chosen as the study period as the academic year begins in March in Korea; thus, the interns were at the end of their internship, and were able to speak about their experiences during the year as a whole. Furthermore, the second group, which consisted of recent medical school graduates who were about to begin their internship, would be able to discuss their student clerkship experiences. The mean age of participants was 27.4 years, with 55% of participants being female. Participants were volunteers and were informed that the results of the survey would be part of a study on medical education.  These competencies are therefore a standard of measure to evaluate residents-in-training, and it is unreasonable to expect clinicians at the student or even intern-level to be proficient in all categories of competency [5].",

The ACGME core competencies were therefore not selected to quantifiably measure clinical skill levels, but rather serve as an adapted guide to the common competencies that all preresidency learners should possess. The sixth competency of systems-based practice was omitted as being inapplicable for the purposes of this study. Some of the survey questions were directly inferred from the core competencies, while others sought to measure the truly basic clinical skills that are required of any doctor. The survey was designed with blank spaces for answers instead of an answer choice bank, in an effort to allow for as much unaided recall as possible (see Appendix 1 for full survey questionnaire).",

But other than the tangible aspects, there are certain parts of patient evaluation that require experience. This kind of experience is something I learned in the ER. Well, for example, I learned that sometimes there can be a psychiatric component to disease that doesn't show up on lab tests. Sometimes patients are more anxious about being sick than they are actually sick, and knowing the difference can be key to providing patients with the tailored care they need to feel better faster."

For example, with a patient who complains of shortness of breath, to ask not just about respiratory symptoms, but symptoms related to cardiovascular or nephrological diseases, and to ask about smoking history, or exposure to allergens.

For example, we had a patient with a traumatic subdural hemorrhage, and based on my notes of the patient's initial mental status, the neurosurgeon determined the midline was shifting and decided to open the patient's skull. In General Surgery, I kept progress reports on all of my patients on a daily basis, and it helped teach me to learn to keep track of my patient's fluid therapy management."
