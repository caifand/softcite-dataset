A sequential statistical methodology comprising of Plackett-Burman and response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to enhance the fermentative production of chitinase, in which inulin was firstly used as an effective carbon source. As a result, maximum chitinase activity of 5.17 U/mL was obtained in the optimized medium, which was 15.5-fold higher than that in the basal medium. The triplicate verification experiments were performed under the optimized nutrients levels which indicated that it well agreed with the predicted value."

It is highly distributed in nature, as a constituent of insect exoskeleton, shells of crustaceans, fungal cell walls (11), and algae components (5). More than 1\u00d710 11 tons of chitin are estimated to be produced annually in marine waters alone, mostly by copepods (24). Most of chitin for commercial are come from shrimp shellfish waste.",

Furthermore, preliminary experiments indicated that chitinase production was significantly influenced by chitin. The high similarity between the observed value and the predicted ones showed that the RSM was an accurate and applicable tool to optimize culture medium for chitinase yield in Chitinolyticbacter meiyuanensis SYBC-H1 industry. By utilizing the statistical methodology, the optimum chitinase activity was determined to be 5.17 U/mL. Under optimized culture conditions, the chitinase activity was 15-fold than that under the original culture conditions. In particular, the culture time was also decreased."
