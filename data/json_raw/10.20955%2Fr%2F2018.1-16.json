The creators' original motivation behind Bitcoin was to develop a cash-like payment system that permitted electronic transactions but that also included many of the advantageous characteristics of physical cash. To understand the specific features of physical monetary units and the desire to develop digital cash, we will begin our analysis by considering a simple cash transaction. 1.1 Cash Cash is represented by a physical object, usually a coin or a note. When this object is handed to another individual, its unit of value is also transferred, without the need for a third party to be involved (Figure 1). No credit relationship arises between the buyer and the seller. This is why it is possible for the parties involved to remain anonymous. The great advantage of physical cash is that whoever is in possession of the physical object is by default the owner of the unit of value. This ensures that the property rights to the units In this article, we give a short introduction to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The focus of the introduction is on Bitcoin, but many elements are shared by other blockchain implementations and alternative cryptoassets. The article covers the original idea and motivation, the mode of operation and possible applications of cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology. We conclude that Bitcoin has a wide range of interesting applications and that cryptoassets are well suited to become an important asset class. (JEL G23, E50, E59)"

The central authority then ensures that the buyer has the necessary funds and adjusts the accounts accordingly ( Figure 3). Centralized payment systems solve the double spending problem, but they require trust. Agents must trust that the central authority does not misuse the delegated power and that it maintains the books correctly in any state of the world-that is, that the banker is not running away with the money.

It was sufficient that all the inhabitants knew who the owner of every stone was. The separation between the unit of value and the stone went so far that even the unit of value for stones that were lost at sea remained in circulation. The stone money of Yap can therefore be described as a quasivirtual currency, as each unit of value was only loosely linked to a physical object. "

The Bitcoin Blockchain is a data file that carries the records of all past Bitcoin transactions, including the creation of new Bitcoin units. It is often referred to as the ledger of the Bitcoin Payment System with a Distributed Ledger system. The Bitcoin Blockchain consists of a sequence of blocks where each block builds on its predecessors and contains information about new Bitcoin transactions. The average time between Bitcoin blocks is 10 minutes. The first block, block #0, was created in 2009; and, at the time of this writing, block #494600 was appended as the most recent block to the chain. Because everyone can download and read the Bitcoin Blockchain, it is a public record, a ledger that contains Bitcoin ownership information for any point in time. The word \"ledger\" has to be qualified here. There is no single instance of the Bitcoin Blockchain. Instead, every participant is free to manage his or her own copy of the ledger. As it was with the stone money, there is no central authority with an exclusive right to keep accounts. Instead, there is a predefined set of rules and the opportunity for individuals to monitor that other participants adhere to the rules.

Consequently, reputation effects cannot be expected to have a significant positive impact, and coordination becomes very difficult.

From a game theoretical perspective, a strategy profile where all miners add valid blocks to their own copies of the Bitcoin Blockchain is a Nash equilibrium. If a miner believes that all other miners are acting accordingly, then it is a best response for that miner to add a valid block candidate to his or her own copy of the Bitcoin Blockchain. A deviation is not worthwhile, because it is not profitable to work on a version of the Bitcoin Blockchain that is not generally accepted. Any reward for finding blocks on a version of the chain that is not accepted by anyone else is worthless. Thus, although there is no authority enforcing this rule and miners are free to modify their copy of the Blockchain as they wish, there is a strong incentive to follow this rule. This self-enforcing rule allows the network to maintain consensus about the ownership of all Bitcoin units. 4 Mining is expensive, as the computations use large amounts of electricity and are increasingly dependent on highly specialized hardware. Moreover, valid block candidates can be found only through a trial-and-error procedure. The consensus mechanism is therefore called \"proof of work.\" If a miner finds a valid fingerprint for a block candidate, then this is proof that he or she has, on average, performed a large number of costly computations. Adding false information (e.g., illegitimate transactions) to a block candidate would render the block candidate invalid and essentially waste all the computations. Finding a valid fingerprint is therefore proof that the miner helped to maintain the Bitcoin system.",

Because of this, the present price of the currency is determined solely by expectations about its future price. A buyer is willing to buy a Bitcoin unit only if he or she assumes that the unit will sell for at least the same price later on. The price of Bitcoin, therefore, reacts highly elas- tically to changes in the expectations of market participants and is reflected in extreme price volatility. From monetary theory, we know that currencies with no intrinsic value have many equilibrium prices. 5 One of them is always zero. If all market participants expect that Bitcoin will have no value in the future, then no one is willing to pay anything for it today. However, Bitcoin is not the only currency that has no intrinsic value. State monopoly currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the Swiss franc, have no intrinsic value either. They are fiat currencies created by government decree. The history of state monopoly currencies is a history of wild price swings and failures. This is why decentralized cryptocurrencies are a welcome addition to the existing currency system. In the Bitcoin system, the path for the money supply is predetermined by the Bitcoin protocol written in 2008 and early 2009. Since then, many changes have been applied to the Bitcoin protocol. Most of these changes are not controversial and have improved the functioning of the Bitcoin system. However, in principle all aspects of the Bitcoin protocol can be amended, including the money supply. Many Bitcoin critics see this as a major shortcoming. Theoretically speaking, this is correct. Any network participant can decide to follow a new set of rules and, for example, double the amount of newly created \"Bitcoin\" units in his or her version of the ledger. Such a modification, however, is of no value because convincing all the other network participants to follow this new set of rules will be almost impossible. If the change of the protocol is not supported unanimously, there will be a so-called fork, a split in the network, which results in two co-existing blockchains and essentially creates a new cryptoasset. In this case, there would be Bitcoin (the original) and Bitcoin42 (a possible name for an alternative implementation with an upper bound of 42 million Bitcoin42 units). The market would price the original and the newly created Bitcoin42 assets according to the community's expectations and support. Therefore, even though in theory it is possible to increase the Bitcoin supply, in practice, such a change is very unlikely because a large part of the Bitcoin community would strongly oppose such an attempt."

Political interference in the fiat currency system can be interpreted as a change in the \"fiat currency protocol.\" Undesirable changes in fiat currency protocols are very common and many times have led to the complete destruction of the value of the fiat currency at hand.

In the absence of a central authority, communicating a payment order in this traditional sense is not possible."

How can one ensure that the transaction message will not be tampered with before it is passed from one node to the next?  In the Bitcoin system, transaction legitimacy is guaranteed using asymmetric cryptography. 6 The idea is based on using pairs of keys consisting of a private and a public key. A private key should not be shared. It corresponds to a random value from an incredibly large set of numbers. A public key, on the other hand, is derived from that number and can be shared freely. It serves as a pseudonym in the Bitcoin network. 7 A private key is used to encrypt a message that can be decrypted only by using its corresponding public key. This type of encryption is also known as a \"signature.\" The signature clarifies that this approach is not used to hide any of the information in the encrypted message. Anyone can simply decrypt a message using its public key, but the signature serves as proof that the message has been previously encrypted using its corresponding private key; it's like a handwritten signature but much more secure.",

Besides infrastructure and operating costs, one would have to calculate the explicit and implicit costs of a central bank.

The answer is no because the price of Bitcoin also depends on aggregate demand. If a constant supply of money meets a fluctuating aggregate demand, the result is fluctuating prices. In government-run fiat currency systems, the central bank aims to adjust the money supply in response to changes in aggregate demand for money in order to stabilize the price level. In particular, the Federal Reserve System has been explicitly founded \"to provide an elastic currency\" to mitigate the price fluctuations that arise from changes in the aggregate demand for the U.S. dollar. Since such a mechanism is absent in the current Bitcoin protocol, it is very likely that the Bitcoin unit will display much higher short-term price fluctuations than many government-run fiat currency units."
