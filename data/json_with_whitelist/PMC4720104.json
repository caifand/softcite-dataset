By Western blot, FOXO1 down-regulation corresponded with increased HIF-1! protein expression under hypoxic conditions, but not under normoxic conditions, in both cell lines (Fig. 1D). Fig. 1A shows that FOXO1 expression was higher in SNU-601 cells than in SNU-638 cells. In contrast, we found that cell growth rate was higher in SNU-638 cells than in SNU-601 cells, which became more evident under hypoxic conditions ( Fig. 2A). To confirm the growth-inhibitory role of FOXO1, we compared the viability of GC cell lines under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. At 24 hours of hypoxic exposure, in both GC cell lines FOXO1 knockdown increased cell viability under hypoxic conditions, but not under normoxic conditions (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B and C). These data suggest that the effect of FOXO1 on GC cell growth needs a hypoxic environment. Fig. 2A shows that SNU-638 cells grow faster than SNU-601 cells. Thus, to examine the role of FOXO1 in GC growth, we injected SNU-638 cells rather than SNU-601 cells into nude mice. Stable SNU-638 cells expressing non-targeting (control) or FOXO1-targeting shRNA were used. We found that tumors were successfully formed in all mice. The tumor weights were markedly higher in mice injected with FOXO1 shRNA expressing cells than those injected with control shRNA expressing cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A).",
