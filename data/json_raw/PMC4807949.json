However, the mechanism of PLCB1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unknown. This study aims to investigate whether its expression is associated with the clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of the patients with HCC. Methods: Immunohistochemistry on two tissue microarrays containing 141 cases of HCC tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues were performed to analyze the correlation between PLCB1 expression and clinicopathological features. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox multivariate analysis were performed to determine the PLCB1 expression in HCC prognosis. Furthermore, effects of PLCB1 on proliferation of HCC cells were explored using a colony formation assay and apoptosis assay. Results: We identified that PLCB1 expression was significantly higher in tumor tissues than that in adjacent non-tumorous tissues and associated with advanced tumor stage. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with PLCB1-positive tumors had poorer survival than the patients with PLCB1-negative tumors. In multivariate analyses, PLCB1 expression was an independent prognostic factor. Moreover, overexpression of PLCB1 in HCC cells promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis, while knocking down PLCB1 reduced cell viability in vitro. Further investigation found that activation of ERK signaling might involve in PLCB1mediated cell growth. Conclusion: Our study suggests that PLCB1 promotes the progression of HCC and can be served as an independent prognostic factor and a promising therapeutic target in HCC."

            "text": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading cause of cancer-related death and the fifth most common malignancy worldwide. Despite the facts that current clinical treatments such as hepatectomy and liver transplantation have made significant achievements for combating this disease, the long-term prognosis of HCC remains unfavorable, and the 5-year survival rate was approximately 12% due to the tumor aggressive metastasis and recurrence. 1,2 Studies on revealing the mechanisms underlying HCC progression have found important oncogenes and pathways which promoted tumor development. 3 However, HCC is a systemic disease, which involves alternations of genes, cells, and tissues which are all deregulated. Thus, aiming to improve the outcome of the patients with HCC, it is necessary to identify novel molecular targets, which play key regulatory roles in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. Phospholipase C, \u03b21 (PLCB1) is encoded by the PLCB1 gene which is located at chromosome 20p12. It is originally identified as a member of GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor)associated PLC-\u03b2 isoforms that catalyze the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). 4 This reaction plays an important role in the intracellular transduction. 5 Deregulation of signal transduction pathways frequently elicits survival advantages to tumors. The PLCB1 is activated by G\u03b1 and triggers a series of events, which lead to an increase in intracellular calcium. 6 One consequence involved of this activation would be aberrant proliferative changes in the cell.",

Then we constructed PLCB1 stably overexpressed HepG2 and Huh7 cells using lentivirus infection. The exogenous of PLCB1 was confirmed using Western blot (Figure 2A). For CCK-8 assay, the results indicated that overexpression of PLCB1 exhibited markedly increased cell viability in relation to the control cells ( Figure 2B). Consistent with the CCK-8 assay, we performed the colony formation assay, and the crystal violet staining showed that upregulation of PLCB1 in HepG2 and Huh7 cells significantly increased their growth compared with control cells ( Figure 2C). Moreover, the apoptosis assay was undertaken when cells were starved for 72 hours. The data showed that caspase-3/7 activity, which was an index of apoptosis, was notably reduced after PLCB1 overexpressed ( Figure 2D). Collectively, these results suggested that PLCB1 overexpression could promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis.",

However, the expression profile and the function of PLCB1 in HCC remain largely unclear. Here, we identified PLCB1 as a novel oncogene and independent prognostic marker of HCC. The in vitro experiments revealed that overexpression of PLCB1 promoted cell growth, while knocking down inhibited the growth. Besides, we found that ERK signaling aberrant activation might be involved in PLCB1-mediated cell growth. More importantly, in clinical specimens, positive correlations between PLCB1 expression and advanced tumor stage suggested that the elevated expression of PLCB1 might contribute to the progression of HCC. Signal transduction networks could transmit information about the external environment of the cell and integrate these stimulations to trigger the activation of cellular internal pathways. The PLCB1 encodes the phosphoinositide-specific enzyme, PLCB1, which could be activated by G-proteins and catalyzes the formation of second messengers, initiating the signal cascade. 19 Several studies have demonstrated that PLCB1 played important roles in modulating various functional aspects of diseases. 10,20 In the murine model, PLCB1 knock out results in an epileptic phenotype. 6 In addition, PLCB1 was involved in the generation of IP3 production evoked by histamine stimulation in HeLa cells. 21 In breast cancer, gain of PLCB1 closely related to histological grade and proliferative index, and low expression of PLCB1 in luminal-like A type tumors which had a relatively good prognosis. 16 An earlier study found that a role for gains on chromosomes 8q and 20 as predictors of poor outcome in hepatoblastomas. 22 The PLCB1 gene is located at chromosome 20p12, which makes us concern its up-regulated status.",

Furthermore, it could be possibly used as a biomarker to identify subsets of HCC with the aggressive phenotype. In addition, the patients with positive PLCB1 exhibited a lower 5-year OS.

We performed in vitro experiments to demonstrate that overexpression of PLCB1 could promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. Moreover, in our study, PLCB1 was observed to activate ERK signaling, which has been proved to affect cell growth and apoptosis. Also, it has been reported that ERK activation could be regulated by dual-specificity phosphatase DUSP1 which dephosphorylated ERK. 23 However, there were slightly changes on DUSP1 expression when we affected PLCB1 expression, suggesting alternative mechanisms underlying regulation of ERK activation. Moreover, it has been reported that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) could cause rapid nuclear translocation of activated ERK and concurrently induce phosphorylation of nuclear PLCB1, initiating the phosphoinositide cycle. 24 These might be a positive regulatory loop between PLCB1 and ERK signaling. In recent years, compounds inhibiting the kinase activity of ERK have yielded preclinical results and made some progress in cancer treatment. 25 As shown in Figure 4C, the proliferation acceleration effect mediated by overexpression of PLCB1 was partially abolished by ERK inhibitor. It has been demonstrated that the antiproliferative efficacy of inhibitors aimed at ERK signals depends on the driver oncogenic lesion. At the next stage of the cascade, expression levels of effectors such as Fra-1 and c-Myc were controlled by ERK activation through an integrative process. 25 In further studies, more experimentation will be required to explore the molecular mechanisms of PLCB1 in HCC pathogenesis and metastasis. In addition, we would also study the role of PLCB1 in a variety of cancers such as colorectal cancer and prostate cancer.",
