Since no truncated proteins can be detected in the mouse retina (10), the lower arrow in (C) points to the level of truncated proteins present in a lysate of infected cells which has been loaded on the same gel as positive control. The molecular weight ladder is depicted on the left. (B) Quantification of ABCA4 protein bands from Western blot analysis in (A). The intensity of the ABCA4 bands in (A) was divided by the intensity of the Filamin A bands.

Values are represented as: mean \u00b1 s.e.m. *pANOVA \u2264 0.05, the asterisk indicates significant differences with AK. **pANOVA < 0.001, the asterisks indicate significant differences with AK, AP1 and AP2.
