An account of all known species of Plagiostoma including Cryptodiaporthe is presented based on analyses of morphological, cultural, and DNA sequence data. Multigene phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences from four genes (\u03b2-tubulin, ITS, rpb2, and tef1-\u03b1) revealed eight previously undescribed phylogenetic species and an association between a clade composed of 11 species of Plagiostoma and the host family Salicaceae. In this paper these eight new species of Plagiostoma are described, four species are redescribed, and four new combinations are proposed. A key to the 25 accepted species of Plagiostoma based on host, shape, and size of perithecia, perithecial arrangement in the host, and microscopic characteristics of the asci and ascospores is provided. Disposition of additional names in Cryptodiaporthe and Plagiostoma is also discussed."

            "text": "The genus Plagiostoma (Gnomoniaceae, Diaporthales) includes microscopic fungi that inhabit the leaves, stems, twigs, and branches of woody and herbaceous plants from a range of families including the Betulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Geraniaceae, Hippocastanaceae, Oleaceae, Polygonaceae, Salicaceae, Sapindaceae, and Staphylaceae in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere . Although some species of Plagiostoma cause diseases, most do not show symptoms prior to production of perithecia on dead tissues. Described by Fuckel (1870), the morphological concept of Plagiostoma remained relatively unchanged (Barr 1978, Monod 1983) until recently. Multigene phylogenetic studies suggest that the genus Plagiostoma forms a highly supported monophyletic clade that includes the type species of Plagiostoma, P. euphorbiae, and the type species of Cryptodiaporthe, C. aesculi, among others (Mej\u00eda et al. 2008.  included 13 species in the genus Plagiostoma, several of which were previously placed in Cryptodiaporthe.",

            "text": "A brief historical account of the major taxonomic treatments of Plagiostoma and Cryptodiaporthe illustrates the views of these genera through time. Fuckel (1870) proposed the genus Plagiostoma for sphaericeaous species characterised by flattened perithecia oriented horizontally having short, lateral, erumpent necks. Fuckel (1870) included the genera Ceratostoma, Gnomonia, Linospora, Melanospora, and Rhaphidospora together with Plagiostoma in the tribe Ceratostomeae of the Sphaeriacei. In his original description of Plagiostoma, Fuckel (1870) included four species, P. euphorbiae, P. petiolicola, P devexum, and P. suspecta. Fuckel's concept of Plagiostoma was followed by H\u00f6hnel (1917)  and von Arx (1951) who, like Fuckel, considered Plagiostoma to be relatively closely related to Gnomonia, the name on which the Gnomoniaceae is based. These authors differentiated Gnomonia from Plagiostoma mainly by orientation of the perithecial neck. Gnomonia was characterised by having central, upright, perithecial necks in contrast to species of Plagiostoma with eccentric, laterally oriented, perithecial necks. In her treatment of the order Diaporthales, Barr (1978) followed Fuckel's concept of Plagiostoma and placed Gnomonia and Plagiostoma in the same suborder Gnomoniineae but in different families, i.e. Gnomonia in the Gnomoniaceae and Plagiostoma in the Valsaceae. The Valsaceae was defined based on having \"beaks oblique or lateral, erumpent separately or converging through stromatic disc\" (Barr, 1978 p. 15). Barr (1978) made nine new combinations in Plagiostoma expanding the number of species in the genus to 13. In his monograph of the Gnomoniaceae, Monod (1983) accepted most species treated by Barr (1978). However, Monod considered that the typification of Plagiostoma as P. euphorbiae by H\u00f6hnel (1917) was not representative of Plagiostoma because the perithecial necks of this species are eccentric rather than lateral as stipulated by Fuckel (1870). Monod (1983) transferred P. euphorbiae to the genus Gnomonia and re-typified Plagiostoma with P. devexum. In agreement with Barr (1991) and  the typification of the genus Plagiostoma with P. euphorbiae by H\u00f6hnel (1917) is accepted here because this typification predates Monod (1983) and is in accordance with Article 10 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (McNeill et al. 2006).",

Four gene fragments were amplified and sequenced for the phylogenetic analyses: the complete nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 including 5.8 S rDNA (ITS), regions of the RNA polymerase second largest subunit (rpb2), beta-tubulin (\u03b2-tubulin), and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-\u03b1) genes. The ITS and rpb2 genes were amplified and sequenced as described in  in 25 \u03bcL reactions with two internal sequencing primers designed specifically for species of Plagiostoma: rpb2 Plag-F (5' CGT CGC TGC ATY ATC TCR CA 3') and rpb2 Plag-R (5' TGY GAG ATR ATG CAG CGA CG 3'). \u03b2-tubulin was amplified using primers T1 and T22 and sequenced with the PCR primers and the internal primers T2 and T12 from O' Donnell & Cigelnik (1997). For some isolates it was necessary to amplify the tef1-\u03b1 region in two fragments using the following primer combinations: EF1-728F /EF1-1199R and EF1-983F/ EF1-1567R (Carbone & Kohn 1999, Castlebury, unpubl. data, for primer 1199R 5' GGG AAG TAC CMG TGA TCA TGT 3', Rehner 2001). The rpb2 gene could not be amplified for P. convexum, P. euphorbiaceum, and P. pulchellum CBS 170.69. In addition, \u03b2-tubulin could not be amplified for P. pulchellum CBS 170.69. For the purpose of determining taxonomic affinities of species previously described as Cryptodiaporthe or Plagiostoma but not congeneric with P. euphorbiae (type species), a region of the nuclear ribosomal large subunit (LSU) was amplified as described in Castlebury et al. (2002).",

A 50 % majority rule consensus tree and a consensus phylogram were constructed from the trees saved after the burn-in period.

The following morphological characters differentiate Plagiostoma from other genera of the Gnomoniaceae as defined by Sogonov et al. (2008, table 2). Unlike Gnomonia, species of Plagiostoma have perithecia that often collapse from the base when dry as illustrated in Sogonov et al. (2008, fig. 43 B-C). In Plagiostoma the neck length is short to long about equal or less than the diameter of perithecia, while in Ophiognomonia the perithecial neck length is usually very long, often pointed, and 2.5-5 times the perithecial diameter. Species of Ophiognomonia occur only on leaves while those of Plagiostoma are found on leaves as well as woody tissues. Except for P. rhododendri, the ascospores of Plagiostoma are not broader at the upper part as in Gnomoniopsis. Ascospores of Plagiostoma are never cylindrical or femuroid as in Cryptosporella. Species of Plagiostoma with ellipsoid, aseptate ascospores similar to those of C. hypodermia do not have a valsoid arrangement of perithecia as do species of Cryptosporella.",

Phragmoporthe conformis, a species closely related to Ditopella ditopa, is characterised by phragmosporic ascospores, a character not present in Plagiostoma. The perithecia of Amphiporthe hranicensis, the type species of Amphiporthe, are grouped near the base of the entostroma and, thus, are different from those found in Plagiostoma. In addition, Amphiporthe hranicensis produces perithecia in clusters of up to 20, with perithecial necks protruding as a group from the host periderm and surrounded by gray stromatic tissue."

Host identity, geographic locality, and presence or absence of stroma are secondary characters for the identification of species. For example, the presence of white stromatic tissues surrounding the emerging perithecial necks is diagnostic in species such as P. aesculi, P. salicellum, and P. samuelsii. Within Plagiostoma perithecial neck shape ranges from very short, cylindrical to expanded and thick or thin, cylindrical and elongated with various shapes in the opening area, e.g. conic, flared, or rounded. In one species, P. versatile, the perithecial neck can be both very short when on twigs or elongated when on a leaf midvein suggesting that this structure varies with substrate. Four species, P. apiculatum, P. convexum, P. dilatatum, and P. imperceptibile, are characterised by having an apically expanded perithecial neck. The expanded neck was noticed by Wallroth (1833, as coronatum dilatatis) and Butin (1958, as cushion-or padlike structure) but neither of these authors used this character to differentiate species. This structure may be involved in rupture of host periderm and release of the ascospores."

Species of Plagiostoma were characterised by the lack of a stroma and production of a single perithecium, primarily on leaves. Species of Cryptodiaporthe were characterised by production of a rudimentary stroma and grouped perithecia, primarily in the bark of their host branches. The differences between Cryptodiaporthe and Plagiostoma have been emphasised such that some authors placed them in different families or subfamilies (Barr 1978, Wehmeyer 1975). Monod's (1983) concept of Plagiostoma differed significantly from the concept presented here. Of the 13 species treated by Monod (1983) as Plagiostoma, only Plagiostoma devexum is accepted here in that genus. Of the 13 species of Plagiostoma accepted by , only P. euphorbiae and P. devexum were originally described as Plagiostoma with Plagiostoma barriae newly described in that work. Plagiostoma aesculi and P. salicellum were previously regarded by Wehmeyer (1933) as Cryptodiaporthe. Four a SySteMatic account of the genuS Plagiostoma additional species of Cryptodiaporthe are here formally combined in Plagiostoma, namely P. apiculatum, P. convexum, P. populinum, and P. pulchellum. The recognition of these four species formerly classified as Cryptodiaporthe salicina broadens the range of morphological and ecological traits of the genus Plagiostoma. The pathogenic species, P. apiculatum, P. fraxini, and P. populinum, contrasts with the concept of Plagiostoma as primarily saprobic.",

Plagiostoma apiculatum (synonym Cryptodiaporthe salicella) is here determined to be the correct name for the fungus causing a canker disease of willow (Sinclair & Lyon 2005). This species, referred to by the anamorph Diplodina microsperma, has been reported as the most abundant endophyte in healthy twigs of Salix fragilis in England (Petrini & Fisher 1990) and is thus an important component of the host microbiota. Similarly, the closely related species P. dilatatum, P. imperceptibile, and P. pulchellum form a black halo or spot on the host surface, a feature that may be associated with the early stages of canker development. Whether or not these species are primarily pathogenic or establish an asymptomatic infection that later develops into cankers needs to be determined. These species form a highly supported monophyletic group (Fig. 1) characterised by having an expanded perithecial neck and broad ellipsoid to renoid ascospores. This group of species is part of a larger, highly supported clade that also includes P. convexum, P. ovalisporum, and P. populinum (synonym Cryptodiaporthe populea), the pathogen causing a canker of poplars. Plagiostoma fraxini causes anthracnose on ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) and fringetree (Chionanthus retusis) (Gregory et al. 2004, Sinclair & Lyon 2005, and is sister to the clade containing three species on Euphorbiaceae.",

It agrees with Wallroth's description of S. apiculata. Fuckel (1870) recircumscribed Sphaeria apiculata Wallr. based on Fungi Rhenani 918. The original Latin description of Sphaeria apiculata includes morphological characters of the perithecia such as an apiculate papilla, i.e. \"coronatum dilatatis\", here interpreted as the diskshaped expansion of the perithecial neck, and \"nucleo atro\" at the apex. These morphological characters are present in the type specimen BPI 799092 of S. apiculata designated here as the lectotype. The protologue of S. apiculata by Wallroth (1833) does not include a description of the ascospores, however, the fungus on this specimen contains broadly ellipsoid ascospores. This specimen and thus Plagiostoma apiculatum is distinctive and differs from Plagiostoma salicellum as discussed under that species.",

            "text": "The concept of the name Sphaeria apiculata has been confused. The following is an account of this species and its various synonyms based on the results of our study of the original description, type specimens, and relevant later specimens. H\u00f6hnel (1917), Petrak (1921), and later authors considered Sphaeria apiculata to have narrowly elongated ascospores while Wehmeyer (1933) recognised this species as having broadly ellipsoid ascospores and considered Cryptodiaporthe salicina to be a synonym. H\u00f6hnel (1917) examined specimens made by Rehm, Krieger, and his own of Diaporthe spina and considered this name to be a synonym of Sphaeria apiculata. He acknowledged differences in perithecial neck length among collections of these two species. To determine the synonymy of these two species we compared the original description of D. spina with the original description of S. apiculata by Wallroth (1833) as well as the recircumscription by Fuckel (1870). In his original description of D. spina Fuckel (1870) provided a drawing that is quite unlike the original description of S. apiculata. Based on the comparison of descriptions and the specimens observed, we do not consider S. apiculata and D. spina to be synonyms. The synonymy of these two species proposed by H\u00f6hnel (1917) and accepted by Petrak's (1921) who provided a description of Cryptodiaporthe apiculata (\u2261 Sphaeria apiculata ) may be the reason that later authors considered S. apiculata to be characterised by narrow, elongated ascospores as described and observed for D. spina. Sogonov, Stud. Mycol. 62: 69. 2008. Note: Sogonov et al. (2008 provided a description and illustrations of this species. Cultures of isolates used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 7G-H Ascospores ellipsoid-fusoid, tapering toward rounded ends, curved or straight, one median to submedian septum, constricted, (16-)18-20(-22) \u00d7 4-5 \u03bcm (mean = 18.5 \u00d7 4.5, SD 1.0, 0.4, n = 51), l : w (3.2-)3.9-4.5(-4.9) (mean = 4.2, SD 0.4, n = 51), with four refractive bodies of various shapes, often globose. Notes: Plagiostoma convexum as Sphaeria convexa was considered a synonym of Cryptodiaporthe salicina by Wehmeyer (1933). Plagiostoma convexum has ascospores that agree with those drawn by Wehmeyer (1933 as C. salicina, plate XIII, figs 3-5). In his description of S. salicina, Currey (1858) mentions that the septum in the sporidia (ascospores) is \"often very difficult to make out\", but the ascospores in his drawing have a septum.  Wehmeyer (1933) listed 28 synonyms of Cryptodiaporthe salicina. Among specimens that Wehmeyer (1933) recognised under that name, Butin (1958) elaborated differences in ascospore morphology, conidial state, host, and ecological characteristics and distinguished three species: C. apiculata (Wallr.) Petr., C. populea (Sacc.) Butin, and C. pulchella (Sacc.) Butin, here accepted as Plagiostoma apiculatum, P. populinum, and P. pulchellum. Butin (1958) did not consider any of these species to be conspecific with Sphaeria salicina Curr. On the contrary he listed Cryptodiaporthe salicina based on Sphaeria salicina Curr. as a synonym of Cryptodiaporthe salicella, here recognised as Plagiostoma salicellum. Although Wehmeyer (1933) listed Sphaeria sphingiophora Oudem. 1873 [\u2261 Diaporthe sphingiophora (Oudem.) Sacc.] as a synonym of C. salicella, S. sphingiophora occurs on Cornus. It is unlikely to be the same species as P. convexum. Diaporthe cupulata Berl. & Destr\u00e9e was considered a synonym of Sphaeria convexa by Wehmeyer (1933), however, the ascospore sizes of these species are different. We do not consider them to be synonymous. The specimen at BPI of Sphaeria salicina Pers., Scleromyceti Sueciae 10, was examined and determined to be a species of Valsa.  Monod (1983).",

It was clearly specified by Fries (1823) that this name is typified by Fries : Scleromyceti Sueciae 188 issued in 1821. According to Wehmeyer (1933) and Butin (1958) confusion about this name was in part due to the fact that different parts of exsiccati Scleromyceti Sueciae 188 contain different species. One of the two species has the narrowly ellipsoid, elongated ascospores of P. salicellum while the other has the broadly ellipsoid ascospores of P. apiculatum. Not recognising the confusion regarding Scleromyceti Sueciae 188, Petrak (1921) wrongly suggested that S. salicella was characterised by having broadly ellipsoid ascospores and made a new combination Cryptodiaporthe salicella (Fr.) Petr. in addition to the new combination C. apiculata (Wallr.) Petr. based on S. apiculata Wallr. The latter species was wrongly considered to have narrowly ellipsoid, elongated ascospores. It is not clear if Petrak (1921) looked at the type specimen of S. apiculata or if he based his conclusions solely on the description of S. apiculata by Wallroth (1833). Wehmeyer (1933) arrived at a conclusion different from that of Petrak (1921). Wehmeyer (1933) studied the exsiccati Scleromyceti Sueciae 188 at the Farlow Herbarium and determined that this number and hence S. salicella Fr. were characterised by having narrowly ellipsoid, elongated ascospores. To use his words, S. salicella represents \"the narrow-spored species\". He synonymised S. salicella Fr. with C. apiculata (Wallr.) Petr. and published the combination C. salicella (Fr.) Wehm. (1933) non Petrak (1921). In addition, Wehmeyer (1933) made the new combination C. salicina (Curr.) Wehm. based on S. salicina Curr. for species having broadly ellipsoid ascospores (see notes under P. convexum). Later Butin (1958) studied species of Cryptodiaporthe on Populus and Salix, examined Scleromyceti Sueciae 188 at Uppsala Herbarium, and suggested that S. salicella should be understood as the species with broadly ellipsoid ascospores and followed Petrak's concept of S. salicella.",

In referring to Scleromyceti Sueciae 188 Fries (1823) described S. salicella as having a powdery \"albicant\" (whitish) stroma and that the multiple ostioles are \"erumpent simultaneously\". The specimen of Scleromyceti Sueciae 188 at BPI includes all of these morphological characters and has ascospores that are ellipsoid elongated (see Fig. 5A, B, D, and G).",

In our study of P. salicellum we noticed that ascospore length and width can be quite variable, even within an ascus, but with a prevalence of elongated ascospores (Fig. 5A-H). A second specimen, BPI 878975 from Germany on Salix repens, was sequenced and determined to be conspecific with the epitype of P. salicellum within a major clade containing two other species having cylindrical ostioles and ellipsoid elongated ascospores. Unlike the lectotype and epitype of P. salicellium, the ascospores of BPI 878975 are ellipsoid but not elongated. In spite of this difference in ascospore morphology, BPI 878975 is P. salicellum based on the cylindrical perithecial neck surrounded by a whitish stroma as well as DNA sequence data.",
