# Softcite-dataset: A dataset of software mentions in scientific publications

## Motivation
    Make software contributions more visible.

## Summary of existing resources
    Cite new review paper.

## Description of the dataset

    - XML form
    - CSV form
    - RDF form

# Creation of the dataset
## Coding apparatus
    - Why? Complexity in creation of coding units same time as coding of those units

    - Window analysis
        - How much could we cut down the content analysis work?
