            "text": "Background: The aim of the present study was to identify chromosomal loci that contribute to the pathogenesis of aortic dissection (AD) in a Korean population using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and to confirm the results using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients with ADs were enrolled in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from individual blood samples, and array CGH analyses were performed. Four corresponding genes with obvious genomic changes were analyzed using real-time PCR in order to assess the level of genomic imbalance identified by array CGH. Results: Genomic gains were most frequently detected at 8q24.3 (56%), followed by regions 7q35, 11q12.2, and 15q25.2 (50%). Genomic losses were most frequently observed at 4q35.2 (56%). Real-time PCR confirmed the results of the array CGH studies of the COL6A2, DGCR14, PCSK6, and SDHA genes. Conclusion: This is the first study to identify candidate regions by array CGH in patients with ADs. The identification of genes that may predispose an individual to AD may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of AD formation. Further multicenter studies comparing cohorts of patients of different ethnicities are warranted."

Therefore, array CGH has been used to detect chromosomal aberrations in mental retardation, epilepsy, and schizophrenia [9][10][11][12]. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used to empirically confirm the results of array CGH [13,14]. Moreover, quantitative real-time PCR has great advantages in measuring DNA copy-number changes owing to the economy, simplicity, and flexibility of the technique [15].",

Despite significant advances in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, the overall in-hospital mortality was 27.4% according to the international registry of aortic dissection [19]. It occurs in 2\u223c9% of the population over 65 years old, and the prevalence may be increasing [20]. Modern diagnostic methods, such as computed or magnetic resonance tomography, are able to show an aortic wall hematoma at the acute onset of the disease. This hematoma will develop into an aortic wall dissection over time [6]. Early recognition and management are crucial, and it is therefore important to be able to rapidly identify aortic dissection, initiate supportive therapy, and refer patients to appropriate specialty care [2]. to detect copy number changes in human diseases, but these techniques have several limitations [22]. Therefore, we attempted to use array CGH. Unlike chromosomal CGH, array CGH highly improves resolution and provides quantitative information of the level of chromosomal gain or loss [16,23].",
