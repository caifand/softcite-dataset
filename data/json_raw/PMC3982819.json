            "text": "We have previously suggested that activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is dependent on cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-related signaling under infectious and restraint stresses, but less dependent on it under hypoglycemic stress. In the present study, we evaluated the neuronal activity in the brain to elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying a stress-specific relevance between COX-2-related signaling and activation of the HPA axis under infectious (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), hypoglycemic (2-deoxy-D-glucose, 2DG) and restraint (1 hr) stress conditions. The number of c-Fos-immunoreactive (IR) cells in several brain regions including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) was increased at 120 min after application of all stress stimuli. The number of c-Fos-IR cells at 30 min was increased only by 2DG in the SON, but not in the PVN. In the PVN, a selective COX-2 inhibitor (NS-398) did not affect the number of c-Fos-IR cells at any time points. On the other hand, in the SON, NS-398 increased c-Fos-IR cells at 30 min after LPS and restraint stresses, but not after 2DG injection. These results suggest that, among the brain regions responding to acute stresses, the PVN and SON are commonly activated under three acute stresses. In addition, it is also suggested that COX-2-related signaling decreases neuronal activity in the SON under infectious and restraint, but not hypoglycemic, stresses, which may be involved in the suppression of the HPA axis."

            "text": "The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis invokes a number of physiological changes that enhance adaptation of the individual in the face of acute stresses [26]. Prostaglandins (PGs) are bioactive lipids derived from arachidonic acid by the sequential actions of phospholipase A, cyclooxygenase (COX) and specific PG synthases [6]. COX exists as the isozymes COX-1, which is constitutively expressed, and COX-2, which is usually expressed at low basal levels and rapidly induced in response to various stimuli [13,24]. COX [7,9,31] and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), a terminal PGE2 synthase [7,8], are involved in the activation of the HPA axis. We have previously demonstrated that selective COX-2 inhibitor NS398 attenuated the increase in serum corticosterone levels at 30 and 120 min after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and restraint stress stimuli. On the other hand, this inhibitory effect of COX-2 inhibitor was not discernible on the 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG)injected animals. These results suggest that activation of the HPA axis is at least partially dependent on COX-2-related signaling under infectious and restraint stresses, but less dependent on it under hypoglycemic stress [15]. However, the mechanisms underlying a stress-specific relevance between COX-2-related signaling and activation of the HPA axis remain to be elucidated.",

The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between hypothalamic COX-2-related signaling and the neuronal activation under three different acute stress conditions. First, we outlined the stress-induced pattern of neuronal activation by means of immunohistochemistry for the immediate early gene product c-Fos in the brain following infectious (LPS), hypoglycemic (2DG) and restraint stress stimuli.

Before the application of stresses (0 min), almost no c-Fos-immunoreactive (IR) cells were observed, while few scattered c-Fos-IR cells were seen in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and the supraoptic nucleus (SON). As shown in Figs. 1-3, stress stimuli induced c-Fos immunoreactivity in many brain regions. After 30 min of stress stimuli, there was a small increase in the number of c-Fos-IR cells in the PVN, SON, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) and piriform cortex (Pir) in the LPS and restraint stress models, while an increase in c-Fos-IR cell number was found in the PVN, SON and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) in the 2DG stress model. Strong increases in c-Fos-IR cells were observed in the PVN and SON at 120 min after the application of all the three different acute stresses. Considerable increases in c-Fos-IR cell number were also seen in other brain regions, including the central amygdaloid nucleus, medial amygdaloid nucleus, arcuate nucleus, dentate gyrus and Pir. In addition, LPS and restraint stresses increased c-Fos-IR cells in the VMH, while 2DG injection increased those in the LHA at 120 min as well as 30 min. These results suggest that the two hypothalamic regions, the PVN and SON, have similar expression patterns of neuronal activation in response to all three different acute stresses applied in this study and that the VMH is sensitive to LPS and restraint stresses, while the LHA is sensitive to hypoglycemic stress. In the PVN of vehicle-injected animals, the numbers of c-Fos-IR cells at 120 min after stress stimuli were significantly larger than those of other 2 time points under all three acute stress conditions. There was no significant difference between the numbers of c-Fos-IR cells in the PVN in vehicle-and NS-398-treated rats at any time points under three different stress conditions. These results suggest that all three acute stress conditions induce the neuronal activation in the PVN and COX-2-related signaling does not affect the total num-ber of neurons activated in this nucleus."

A previous research showed that acute stresses increased c-Fos-IR cells, which were mainly colocalized with CRH-IR perikarya in the PVN [20]. In addition, c-Fos-IR nuclei were also increased in both AVP-and OXT-containing neurons of the PVN and SON after acute stresses [16,20,32]. The present study demonstrated that many regions of the brain respond to acute stresses and especially, the PVN and SON have similar expression patterns of neuronal activation in response to three different acute stresses, which are consistent with these previous reports. It is well known that CRH and AVP play a key role in mediating activation of the HPA axis [18,21], while some researches suggested that intracerebroventricular infusion of OXT suppresses stress-induced activation of the HPA axis [28,29]. In the present study, there was no significant difference between the number of c-Fos-IR cells in the PVN between vehicle-injected and NS-398-treated animals at any time points under three different acute stress conditions, suggesting that COX-2-related signaling is not directly involved in stress responses in the PVN. This is consistent with a previous report showing that COX-2-or mPGES-1-deficient mice did not show any attenuation of the c-Fos expression in the PVN after LPS administration [7], though the other research group reported that LPS strongly reduced the number of c-Fos positive nuclei in the PVN in mPGES-1-deficient mice [4]. As to the SON, on the other hand, the numbers of c-Fos-IR cells in NS-398-treated animals were significantly higher than those in vehicle-injected animals at 30 min under LPS and restraint stresses, but not under 2DG stress condition. Lacroix et al. [14] reported that injection of PGE2 induced c-Fos expression in the PVN and SON.",

            "text": "In the parvocellular division of the PVN, c-Fos was mainly expressed in CRH-and OXT-IR neurons and very rarely expressed in AVP-IR neurons, while in the magnocellular part of the PVN and SON, c-Fos was mainly colocalized in OXT-IR neurons and some expression was also detected in AVP-IR neurons. It is therefore likely that, in the present study, c-Fos-IR neurons in the PVN are mainly CRH and OXT neurons, and those in the SON are mainly OXT neurons. Taken together, it is suggested that, in the SON,  NS-398 increased the number of OXT neurons expressing c-Fos and thereby decreased serum corticosterone levels under infectious and restraint stress conditions as observed in our previous study [15]. This may at least partially account for the differences in COX-2-dependency of the activation of the HPA axis among stresses. Interestingly, in the present study, infectious and restraint stresses increased c-Fos expression levels in the VMH, while hypoglycemic stress increased those in the LHA, which are consistent with previous researches reported separately [1,2,10,22]. Bilateral electrolytic lesions of the VMH or LHA were reported to inhibit corticosteroid feedback or extinguish the role of serotonin (5-HT) on activity in the HPA axis [25]. In addition, involvement of the VMH and LHA in the regulation of energy metabolism has been well documented [30]. The VMH and the LHA have been regarded as the 'satiety center' and 'hunger center', respectively [23]. Infectious stress is known to induce anorexic symptoms, in which condition the satiety center should be activated, while 2DG as an inhibitor of glucose uptake would stimulate the hunger center. Taken together, these results suggest that infectious and restraint stresses or hypoglycemic stress differently acti-  vates neurons in the VMH or LHA mediating the regulation of not only the HPA axis activity but also food intake.",

In addition, it is also suggested that COX-2-related signaling decreases neuronal activity in the SON under infectious and restraint, but not hypoglycemic, stresses, which may be involved in the suppression of the HPA axis. This difference in the role of COX-2-related signaling in inhibiting SON neurons among stresses may at least partially account for the difference in the role of COX-2-related signaling in activating the HPA axis among stresses observed in our previous study [15].
